                    My journey into the software industry is a long one. I graduated from Arizona State University in 2015
                    with a BFA in Photography, after which I took a full time position with the Bollinger Atelier art foundry. I started 
                    doing grunt work and quickly moved up to the digital replication department where my life-long love of computers finally 
                    materialized into a career. After nearly 3 years I wanted to do more, so I took a chance and left the foundry to get my degree in 
                    Computer Science from ASU with an anticipated graduation of December 2020.

                    I interned as an Application Developer for Nationwide E&amp;S in summer 2020 where I worked with Angular, Spring Boot, Java, 
                    and Docker with Kubernetes.

                    I have too many hobbies. I have my own studio where I do welding, metalworking, and wood working. I LOVE arduio 
                    so I play around with circuitry all the time. I also have a deep passion for video games and making things with Unity and 
                    Blender. And whenever I have a chance, I love camping and hiking.
